\textbf{Application for Information Technology Technician}

\opening{Dear Robert Draksler}


I was made aware of your requirements for a technician skilled in computer science by my friend and
your employee, Rafael Abreu Marques. Delighted to learn about the requirements, having a valuable
set of skills in the computer science field, and actively looking to move abroad, I would like to
introduce myself. My name is Pedro Rodrigues and with determination and confidence in delivering, I
would like to spontaneously offer my expertise to fulfill the requirements mentioned above.

I've finished my school years in a professional course in management and programming of information
systems, where I've developed crucial skills and concepts in computer languages. Mainly focused on
C\#.NET, database systems such as SQL, and computer networks principles and application in
Microsoft's solutions. Which was just the culmination of beeing fascinated with computers since a
very early age in life.

In the final stages of the course, I had been gathering know-how in the various enterprise used
solutions, helping in management of a small datacenter, client VPN networks, and beeing part of a
team that worked from the beginning to product release of the website of portugals largest feed
bank Banco Alimentar. During a 6 month internship program at Variograma I've gathered valuable
teamwork knowledge and worked with tools like software version control and linux operating systems.

Shortly afterwards, I was approached by a company set in Angola. They were planning to implement
PHC's ERP software. At the time I was already a fully qualified technician for such a task and they
needed someone with knowledge in various IT areas to manage their IT department. I've spent over 2
years working for Casacon. I was able to fully apply and gain profound knowledge in entreprise
networks. Working with hardware providers for network and datacenter environments such as DELL,
Cisco, Juniper, and HP as well as key software providers such as VMWare and Microsoft.

Interested in a position different from the reocurring maintenance jobs, I joined Primavera as a
technical consultant in Angola for their ERP software. This time, I was responsible to advise IT
managers from various clients on how to manage and configure their environments for correct
deployment of ERP software. Here, I learned about Microsoft SQL server extensively, despite having
worked similar deploys at Casacon, and python as a tool to automated work.

In 2017 I decided to move back to Portugal, where I've been developing tools for flight management
and an Android application which will be released in the upcoming months.

\closing{Your sincerely.}
