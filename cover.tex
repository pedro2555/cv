\textbf{Application for Information Technology Technician}

\opening{Dear}

I was made aware of your requirements for a technician skilled in computer science by my friend,
and your employee, Rafael Abreu Marques. Delighted to known such requirements, having a valuable
set of skills in the computer science field, and actively looking to move abroad, my name is Pedro
Rodrigues and with determination and confidence in delivering, I would like to spontaneously offer
my expertise to fulfill such requirements.

I've finished my school years in a proffessional course in management and programming of
information systems, where I've develop crucial skills and concepts in, computer languages mainly
focused in C\#.NET, database systems such as SQL, and computer networks principles and application
in Microsoft's solutions. Which was just the culmination of beeing fascinated with computers since
very early age.

During the final stages of the course, I've had been gathering know how in the various entreprise
used solutions, helping in management of a small datacenter, client VPN networks, and beeing part
from the beginning to product release of the largest Portuguese feed bank website. At Variograma,
I've also learned valuable team work knowledge and tools such software version control, and linux
operating systems, during a 6 month internship program.

Little time afterwards, I was approached by a company in Angola, they whore looking to implement
PHC's ERP Software which I was a made a qualified technician before, and they needed someone who
knowledge in various IT areas to manage their IT department. I've spent little over 2 years with
Casacon, I was able to fully apply and gain profound knowledge in entreprise networks. Working
with hardware providers for network and datacenter enviroments such as DELL, Cisco, Juniper,
and HP, as well as key software providers such as VMWare and Microsoft.

Interested in a different position than the, by now, recurring maintenance jobs, I joined
Primavera as a technical consultant in Angola for their ERP software. This time, I was responsible
to advise IT managers from various clients on how to manage and configure their enviroments for
correct deployment of ERP software. In here I learned Microsoft SQL server extensively, despite
having worked similar deploys at Casacon, and python as a tool to automate work.

In 2017 decided to move back to Portugal, where I've been developing tools for flight management
and an Android application to be released in the upcoming months.

\closing{Your sincerely.}
